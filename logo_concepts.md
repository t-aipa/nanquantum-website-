# NΛN Quantum Logo Concepts

## Concept 1: Quantum Lambda
This logo concept centers around the lambda (Λ) character as the focal point, representing both quantum superposition and mathematical precision:

```
  N Λ N
QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
```

- The lambda is enlarged and stylized with a subtle gradient from Quantum Blue (#0B3B8F) to Integrity Teal (#00A9AC)
- The "N" characters are in a clean, geometric sans-serif font
- "QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES" appears in smaller all-caps below the main logo
- The lambda can stand alone as an icon in favicon and app contexts

## Concept 2: Quantum Circuit
This concept incorporates quantum circuit elements into the typography:

```
  N⟨Λ⟩N
```

- The lambda is enclosed in quantum circuit notation symbols
- Circuit lines extend subtly from the characters
- A quantum wave pattern appears as a subtle background element
- The full name "QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES" appears below in a clean sans-serif

## Concept 3: Mathematical Integrity
This concept emphasizes the mathematical verification aspect:

```
  N|Λ|N
```

- The lambda is enclosed in vertical bars representing mathematical absolute value notation
- A subtle matrix of numbers appears in the background
- The logo conveys mathematical precision and verification
- "Verified Quantum" appears as a tagline below the main logo

## Concept 4: Quantum Superposition
This concept visualizes quantum superposition:

```
  N Λ N
```

- The letters have subtle ghost versions offset slightly, representing superposition
- The "Λ" has multiple states visualized through transparency
- A circular quantum state diagram surrounds the logo
- Clean, minimalist typography with ample whitespace

## Concept 5: Enterprise Verification
This concept emphasizes enterprise-grade verification:

```
  N✓Λ✓N
```

- Small verification checkmarks appear above the letters
- The lambda is emphasized through size and color
- A shield or verification seal can accompany the logo
- "Enterprise Quantum Verification" appears as a tagline

## Logo Usage Guidelines

### Minimum Size
- Print: 0.5 inches (12.7mm) wide
- Digital: 100px wide

### Clear Space
- Maintain clear space equal to the height of the "N" character on all sides

### Color Variations
- Full color (primary)
- All white (for dark backgrounds)
- All Quantum Blue (for single-color applications)
- Black (for monochrome printing)

### Prohibited Uses
- Do not stretch or distort
- Do not change the proportions
- Do not use unapproved colors
- Do not add effects like shadows or outlines
- Do not place on busy backgrounds without proper contrast
