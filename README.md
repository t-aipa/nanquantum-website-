# NΛN Quantum Technologies Website

## Overview
Official website for NΛN Quantum Technologies, showcasing our mathematically verified quantum computing solutions with uncompromising integrity at every step.

## Key Features
- Mathematical integrity verification system with state-type-aware coherence tracking
- Proprietary quantum architecture delivering reliable and consistent results
- Industry-specific quantum solutions for Finance, Pharma, and Energy sectors
- Comprehensive verification that maintains coherence throughout computation

## Development
This website is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses GitHub Pages for deployment with a custom domain (nanquantum.com).

## Structure
- `index.html` - Homepage
- `pages/` - All subpages (technology, solutions, products, etc.)
- `css/` - Stylesheets
- `js/` - JavaScript files
- `images/` - Image assets

## Deployment
The site is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Technical Notes
- Our quantum algorithms feature consistent method naming conventions
- The unified quantum verification framework uses coherence threshold (>0.9) and normalization deviation (<1e-5)
- Proper iteration settings: 3-5 for standard numbers, 7-10 for challenging numbers
- Proprietary technology ensures integrity throughout complex calculations
